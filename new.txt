DESCRIPTION: TGI model.
              
This model is based on:
Stein WD, Gulley JL, Schlom J, et al. Tumor regression and growth rates determined in five intramural NCI prostate cancer trials: the growth rate constant as an indicator of therapeutic efficacy. Clin Cancer Res. 2011;17(4):907-917. doi:10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-1762

It is a regression-growth model that goes as follows:

TS = TS0*(exp(-kkill*t)+exp(kge*t)-1)

where:
- TS is the size of the tumor cell population.
- V0 is the tumor size at T0.
- T0 is the earliest time.
- kge is the tumor exponential growth rate.
- kkill is the treatment-induced tumor kill/shrinkage rate (exponential decay).

The treatment effect is delayed. 

[LONGITUDINAL]
input = {V0, T0, kge, kkill,F}
V0 = {use=regressor}
T0 = {use=regressor}


EQUATION:

if t < 0 ; before treatment (kkill = 0)
 TS = V0*exp(kge*(t-T0))
else
 TS = V0*exp(kge*(-T0))*(F*exp(kge*t)+(1-F)*exp(-kkill*t))
end

OUTPUT:
output = {TS}
